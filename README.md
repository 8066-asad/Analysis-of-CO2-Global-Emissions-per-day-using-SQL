# Carbon Emissions Analysis - Advanced SQL Project

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project analyzes global carbon emissions data (2023-2025) using advanced SQL techniques to uncover trends, patterns, and insights across countries and sectors. The analysis demonstrates proficiency in complex SQL queries, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Rows**: 66,301 records
- **Columns**: country, day, sector, carbon_emissions_mt
- **Time Period**: January 2023 - April 2025
- **Scope**: Global carbon emissions across multiple sectors

## 🔍 Key Research Questions

1. Which countries and sectors contribute most to global emissions?
2. How have emissions evolved year-over-year across different regions?
3. What seasonal patterns exist in carbon emissions?
4. Which countries show the most significant improvement or deterioration trends?
5. Can we identify anomalies or unusual emission patterns?

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Advanced SQL Techniques
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Complex, multi-layered queries
- **Window Functions**: LAG, LEAD, RANK, ROW_NUMBER for trend analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Standard deviation, rolling averages, z-scores
- **Date Manipulation**: EXTRACT, date arithmetic, temporal grouping
- **Conditional Logic**: CASE statements for categorization
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries for complex filtering

### Statistical Methods
- Year-over-year growth calculations
- Rolling averages (7-day, 30-day)
- Anomaly detection using z-scores
- Volatility analysis
- Trend categorization

## 📈 Key Analyses

### 1. Emissions Landscape
- Total emissions ranking by country
- Sector-wise distribution analysis
- Statistical measures (mean, std dev, min/max)

### 2. Temporal Trends
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Month-over-month changes
- Seasonal pattern identification
- Quarterly trend analysis

### 3. Advanced Trend Analysis
- Countries with dramatic emission changes
- Sector performance across top emitters
- Multi-dimensional country rankings

### 4. Time Window Analysis
- Rolling averages and moving windows
- Anomaly detection and outlier identification
- Volatility measurements

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open the `carbon_emissions_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload your dataset or use the sample data generator
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. Visualizations will appear inline

### Option 2: Local Database
1. Install PostgreSQL or SQLite
2. Import the dataset into your database
3. Run the SQL queries from `queries.sql`
4. Use the Python script for visualizations

### Option 3: BigQuery
1. Upload dataset to Google BigQuery
2. Modify queries for BigQuery syntax
3. Run analysis in BigQuery console or Colab
